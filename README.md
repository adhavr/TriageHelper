#Patient Triage Ranking System
This project is a web application designed for doctors and hospitals to input patient information and receive a triage ranking generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). The system aims to assist healthcare professionals in prioritizing patient care based on the severity of their condition.

Features
Patient Information Input: Doctors and hospitals can enter patient details such as symptoms, medical history, and vital signs.

Triage Ranking: An LLM processes the input data and outputs a triage ranking (1-5).

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive web interface for easy data entry and result display.


Usage
Enter Patient Information: Fill out the form with the patient's details.

Submit the Form: Click the submit button to send the data to the backend.

View Triage Ranking: The LLM will process the data and display the triage ranking on the screen.
